So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"54ee9208","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore-input"],"id":"54ee9208","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721289642940,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":719,"user":{"displayName":"Kevin Zhou","userId":"06321602368159586531"}},"outputId":"3ee952c8-fae5-455c-d3ca-4afd6f012077"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before flattening:  tensor([[[[ 0,  1],\n","          [ 2,  3],\n","          [ 4,  5]]],\n","\n","\n","        [[[ 6,  7],\n","          [ 8,  9],\n","          [10, 11]]]])\n","After flattening:  tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n","        [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]])\n"]}],"source":["def flatten(x):\n","    N = x.shape[0] # read in N, C, H, W\n","    return x.view(N, -1)  # \"flatten\" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image\n","\n","def test_flatten():\n","    x = torch.arange(12).view(2, 1, 3, 2)\n","    print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","    print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","test_flatten()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d8b0aff","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"8d8b0aff"},"source":["### Barebones PyTorch: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here we define a function `two_layer_fc` which performs the forward pass of a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network on a batch of image data.

You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation
